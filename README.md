# Welcome to Handsome Hounds!
This is my website for educational purposes, offering fictional dog grooming. 

The site displays a welcome landing page, a gallery of photos of assorted dog breeds either freshly groomed or being groomed, information on reasons to get your dog groomed, opening times and contact information, an enquiry & quote request form, and social media links. 

On completion of the contact form, the user is also guided to an acknowledgement, made to match the theme of the other web pages with full navigation still visable for users onward movement throughout the site. 


# Wireframes
- The original attempt at wireframe below (only on mobile) were quickly obsolete.
- I found that I shaped the look of the website (mobile first) through the development process itself.

 - The imagery chosen reflects the variety of sizes and types of dog breeds catered for along with the variery of services offered (washing, cutting, brushing, nails).

- The imagery chosen shows happy healthy animal exhibiting positive results for both dogs and owners. 

# Styles

 -I have changed the color scheme completely.  Whilst the old color scheme was "pretty", I have approached this version of the project from the perspective of accessibility. In particular   with visual impairment in mind. The previous color scheme did not conform to the required contrast ratio. 
- Whilst I changed various elements to different colors during the development process to enable me to understand layout, the two colors in use are and  to reflect the closest I could get to my chosen color scheme whilst being compliant for accessibility. 
 - The color palette chosen reflects a bright positive background with easy to read text. 
 - The muted earthy tones contrast well against the blue background whilst reflecting the nuetral tones of dog's fur.

# Fonts
- Original fonts chosen  font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, found to be now deleted or unsupported by Google fonts. 
 - New fonts chosen font-family: Roboto Flex, Roboto Mono.
Ref recommended on https://morningtrain.dk/en/examples-of-good-fonts/  because:
They work well digitally, whereas other fonts may be better suited for print.
The shape of the letters makes them easy to read.
They are fairly neutral fonts, so they can fit many different use cases across industries.
All of the above-mentioned fonts belong to the so-called “Sans-serif” family.
This group of fonts does not have “feet”, making it easier to read on the web where feet can quickly consist of too few pixels and become unclear to the reader.
 - Dev notes on fonts: Lato, Roboto & Ubuntu proving extremely similar and hard to discern during initial implimentation. This may resolve with further dev by using different font sizes or weight. 
 I did not rule out the need to reselect another font. 
I have updated the font choices for two reasons: 
1. I discovered that the original fonts that I chose are no longer available / supported. 
2. In assessing the best fonts to use for accessibility I ensured to select new fonts that meet that criteria. 

# Features

## Favicon
Favicon 
That little picture or icon that appears on the brower tab. 

Working favicon on my site: (Light mode)

![image](https://github.com/stephanielenehan/PP1-Handsome-Hounds/assets/35435182/56d9bdf8-ef88-4611-bfb2-447223bed615)

Working favicon on my site: (Dark mode)

![image](https://github.com/stephanielenehan/PP1-Handsome-Hounds/assets/35435182/43eedabc-1faf-4659-b674-822aa3465b3d)

According to favicon.io "Some alternative names for favicon are browser icon, favorite icon, shortcut icon, tab icon, URL icon, and bookmark icon. The word favicon is short for “favorite icon” and originates from Internet Explorer’s “Favorites” feature which most modern browsers call “bookmarks”."

I have ensured to include the format of ICO along with PNG or SVG for several reasons:
- The ICO file format was developed by Microsoft and is the original file format for the favicon. The format is unique because it allows for multiple small images within the same file. This is advantageous because the small icons required for a favicon in ICO format (16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels) can be scaled and optimized independently. At small dimensions you can’t rely on the browser to automatically resize your icon in an optimal way. 
- The ICO format is supported by all browsers and it’s the only format that IE5 through IE10 supports. Much as Microsoft Internet Explorer had been replaced by Microsoft Edge, as I am developing a site for optimum userability across multiple browsers I thought it would be remiss of me to select a format/s that definatly excluded compatability with Internet Explorer as according to Internet Explorer's own statistics as of 2023 they still had 28 million users worldwide.

 Why bother with a favicon?
- Brand recognition and association. 
  A favicon is used to help users visually identify websites, web pages, and web applications more easily within browser tabs, bookmarks, shortcuts, and address bars more easily. It’s important to have a favicon for your website for brand recognition so that your users can easily identify your site in their browser tabs and bookmarks.

Which favicon and why? 
- Lots of websites use their product or service logo as its favicon to stay consistent with the company's brand and maintain that association people have with a certain logo as a brand or product identification. 
- The dog image chosen easily shows the user which possible tab they have open will be the obvious on for Handsome Hounds.

 Future Development : Match Favicon to Logo

## Manual Testing
write out feature and say how you checked it. 
 - how I tested it in bullet points

BUG: 
I had a definite issue with the overflow of my header and the content being pushed to the right off the screen (regardless of screen size).
BUG RESOLUTION:
I identified the issue after some time as missing the semi-colon in the imported google font which is immediately prior to the asterisk wildcard selector in my css. The missing semi-colon couldn't be immediately seen as the imported google font ran off the page. The omission of the semi-colon's effect was that the asterisk wildcard selector didn't run. I couldn't see at the time that the asterisk had a white coloring with a red squiggly line underneath. I solved the bug using diffchecker.com website. When I pasted in the code for the lines with the wildcard selector, I also pasted in the imported google font above it. Only when the google font then showed in full on the screen did I see the missing semi-colon and begin to understand the issue and also to recognise the indicators of the error.  


 A typical debugging process might look like the following:
1.	A bug is identified either by a user or by a developer during testing/development.
2.	The developer (if the bug was reported by a user) tries to reproduce the bug and verifies that it exists.
3.	The developer starts at the moment of user input, first verifying that the input is received correctly.
4.	The developer follows the code line by line, displaying output along the way until he or she identifies a problem in a function imported from an external library.
5.	The developer Googles some information about the problem or visits the external library's documentation to verify he or she is using the function properly.
6.	The developer identifies a mistake in the way they were utilizing the external library and makes the appropriate changes to the code.
7.	The developer tests the same input again verifies the code is functioning correctly and the rest of the application has not been affected and then deploys the change.

Some questions you should get in the habit of asking yourself are:
1.	What did I expect to happen when the code was run?
2.	Precisely what happened when the code was run?
3.	Am I (or is the user) submitting the correct input?
4.	Do all the variables in use in the code have the correct values?
5.	Is the data I'm working with the correct data type?
6.	Are there any functions changing or mutating the data, the input, or the output before the final step of the code?
7.	What am I literally asking the computer to do, and is that actually what I want it to do?
